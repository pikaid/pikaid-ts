# Pikaid (TypeScript)

**Small · Sortable · Secure ID generator**

Pikaid is a 26-character, lowercase Base36 identifier composed of a 7-character timestamp and a 19-character cryptographically secure randomness. It provides a modern, compact alternative to UUID and ULID, with built-in lexicographical sortability and strong collision resistance.
